The problem CogniLink solves
Difficulty in Daily Tasks:
Individuals with limited mobility face significant challenges in performing routine tasks such as preparing meals or managing basic chores independently due to their physical limitations.
Lack of Suitable Community Platforms:

Conventional social media and community platforms are not adequately designed to cater to the needs of differently abled individuals. There's a lack of inclusive, comfortable, and value-adding community solutions for people with disabilities.
**Isolation and Need for Connection:

Differently abled individuals often feel isolated, lacking a platform that not only addresses their daily challenges but also fosters connections with like-minded individuals to share ideas, creative solutions, and form meaningful connections.
Impact of the Pandemic:

The pandemic exacerbated the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities, especially those reliant on caregivers for daily tasks. Access to support and solutions became more crucial as isolation increased.
Empowerment through Small Wins:

Celebrating and sharing small victories or life hacks significantly motivates differently abled individuals. Providing a space to share these solutions can empower them and encourage them to engage more in their community.
The goal is to address these problem statements by creating a community-driven platform like Sharability (or CogniLink) that offers a practical, accessible, and supportive space for differently abled individuals to share life hacks, connect with peers, and empower each other.
